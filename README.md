# AI Studio Fellowship for JP Morgan Chase.

## Project Description:
- Developed a **supervised classification and regression models** that finds the overall sentiment of that day's financial news and predicts the stock markets movement based on that sentiment.

## Objectives:
1. **From News to Sentiment** – Classify financial news into positive, neutral, or negative categories.
2. **Stock Price Prediction** – Develop models to predict stock price movements based on news sentiment.
3. **AI Agent Integration** – Implement LLM-based AI agents to fetch real-time financial news and predict stock movements.
